//An array is an ordered collection of values
const odd = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
/*
If you Insert or Remove from the end of the array the time complexity is O(1).
If you Insert or Remove from the begnning it's Linear O(n)
This is because the index must be reset for every remaining element in the array.
