//An array is an ordered collection of values
const odd = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
/*
If you Insert or Remove from the end of the array the time complexity is O(1).
If you Insert or Remove from the begnning it's Linear O(n)
This is because the index must be reset for every remaining element in the array.

Accessing an element is constant time complexity because 
fetching the 1st element is no different from fetching an element
at the position of 100,000

Search - O(n)
Push/Pop - O(1)
Shift / unshift / concat / slice / splice - O(n)
